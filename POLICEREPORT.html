    <h1>Police Report - July 2025</h1>
    <p>Summary: What looks like a home break-in. Neighbors reported seeing a strange black figure at night break into the house of the current victim and also missing person known as ULTmonke.</p>
    <p>After further investigation, we found a journal with 6 pages but one of the pages is missing.</p>
    <p>We will continue investigating but for now we must make this known to the public â€” do NOT go inside [REDACTED] forest. If our suspect is still there, it may be too dangerous.</p>
    <p>A few days after we investigated the break-in of ULTmonke's house, one of our detectives named (REDACTED) questioned a young man who claims to know about the creature residing in the (REDACTED) forest.</p>
