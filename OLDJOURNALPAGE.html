  <p>The creature it came by and it started pushing the tree I'm on over. But after some failed attempts it walked away. It doesn't seem to be very strong so I think I'll be safe so I'm gonna get some sleep and get out of here in the morning. I can see some giant building that looks like a laboratory so maybe I can head over there and tell them what I seen. I have a feeling they know what this thing is.</p>
