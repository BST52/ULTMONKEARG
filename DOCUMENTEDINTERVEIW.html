  <h1>Documented Interview #1130</h1>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: so you're here to answer some questions as well as give us some information correct?</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: yes that is correct.</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: Alright then, if you don't mind, the camera in the back corner will be recording for documentation of this interview. Is that ok?</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: yes that is fine.</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: Alright then, allow us to begin interview number 1130, also known as anomaly information. First thing: what is it that you know of this entity?</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: what I know about specimen 5? well specimen 5 is a complex being created in <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span> county laboratory. It was kept in a one-way glass box—meaning it couldn't see us, but we could see it. Specimen 5 was a very intelligent creature with an IQ far greater than the average human's. In fact, you could say it's the smartest organism on the planet.</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: you called it specimen 5? are you implying there's more than one of these things?</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: no—well, technically yes, but the other 4 were failed experiments and died later on in their early life stages. Specimen 5 was the only one who made it through.</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: Alright, I think that's enough info about it. I know there's probably more to share, but just in case this is revealed to the public, I think it's better to keep that information private. Anyways—how did specimen 5 escape from your—</div>
  <div class="line">(Lights flicker then shut off)</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: Oh... how strange.</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: it's here...</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: What do you mean it's here?</div>
  <div class="line">(screaming can be heard outside the interviewing room)</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: it's coming for us...</div>
  <div class="line">Detective <span class="redacted">(REDACTED)</span>: What do you mean by that? Are you implying that I—</div>
  <div class="line">(the door breaks open and both men are taken by the creature. Following that, the camera shuts off.)</div>
