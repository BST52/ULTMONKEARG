  <h1>Lab Report On Specimen 5</h1>
  <p>Date: December 20th 2024. Lead scientist(s): Dr. Madalyn Barkley. Cause for report: This is a new experiment that needs its first report.</p>
  <p>Experiment name: Specimen 5 Also known as the "Dark Anomaly" as most of the other lead scientists refer to call it.</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Madalyn Barkley's statement:</strong> Specimen 5 is a rather interesting experiment. Its behavior depends on its mood. If it's in a calm or docile state, Specimen 5 is rather peaceful, but we have noticed that this behavior is very rare. It's when it's angry—the most common mood for it—that its behavior becomes predatory... toward anything that breathes.</p>
  <p>This is where it gets its "Dark Anomaly" name. When we brought it to the (REDACTED) room to further analyze its format, we came across many strange things. For starters, it took many doses and vials of anesthesia to knock it out—very unusual for any of our experiments, let alone any creature on the planet. The other things we noticed are documented below.</p>
  <p><strong>Experiment's supernatural abilities:</strong><br>
  Specimen 5 is the first ever experiment since Specimen 1 to have supernatural abilities.</p>
  <p><em>First:</em> Specimen 5 has the ability to change its height. The tallest we have recorded it at was around 7 feet, the shortest was around 4 feet. We don't know exactly why it does this, but some of our scientists think it has something to do with its mood. Further testing will be done.</p>
  <p><em>Second:</em> Specimen 5 can get into this strange form that makes it look like a snake. While it’s very rare that it does this—and staff members have only seen it do this a few times—the fact it can change its shape is very unusual. We will do more testing to see what this new form is capable of.</p>
  <p><em>Third:</em> Specimen 5 has a heavy EMP that can fry and power off any electrical devices. While we haven’t had an incident with Specimen 5 using this EMP on the facility, we’ve seen it use it in testing many times with electrical devices. This, paired with its black oil-like skin, makes it a very dangerous experiment.</p>
  <p>Those are all of the abilities we’ve noticed so far. If we find more, we will document them.</p>
