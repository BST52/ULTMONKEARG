  <h1>Lab Report On Specimen 5</h1>
  <p>Date: December 20th 2024.</p>
  <p>Lead scientist(s): Dr. Madalyn Barkley.</p>
  <p>Cause for report: This is a new experiment that needs its first report.</p>
  <p>Experiment name: Specimen 5 — Also known as the "Dark Anomaly" as most of the other lead scientists refer to it.</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Madalyn Barkley's Statement:</strong> Specimen 5 is a rather interesting experiment. Its behavior depends on its mood. If it's in a calm or docile state, Specimen 5 is rather peaceful. But we have noticed that this behavior is very rare and is not common. It's when it's angry — the most common mood for it — that its behavior becomes predatory... toward anything that breathes. This is where it gets its "Dark Anomaly" name from. When we brought it to the (REDACTED) room to further analyze ...
  <p><strong>Experiment's Supernatural Abilities:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Height Shifting:</strong> Specimen 5 can change its height. The tallest we’ve recorded is 7 feet, the shortest is 4 feet. Some scientists believe this correlates with its mood.</li>
    <li><strong>Snake Form:</strong> It can shift into a snake-like form. This is rare, and only observed a few times, but very abnormal. Further testing required.</li>
    <li><strong>EMP Pulse:</strong> It can release a heavy EMP that disables all electronics. While not used during an incident, it has been tested and confirmed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This paired with its black, oil-like skin makes it an extremely dangerous experiment. Those are all of the abilities known so far. Any new findings will be documented in future reports.</p>
