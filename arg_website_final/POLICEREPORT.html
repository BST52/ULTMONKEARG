  <h1>POLICE REPORT - CASE FILE #0451</h1>
  <p><strong>DATE:</strong> July 2025</p>
  <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> What looks like a home break-in. Neighbors reported seeing a strange black figure at night breaking into the house of the current victim and also missing person known as <strong>ULTmonke</strong>.</p>
  <p>After further investigation, we found a journal with 6 pages â€” but <span class="glitch">one of the pages is missing</span>.</p>
  <p>We will continue investigating, but for now, we must make this known to the public: <em>Do not go inside <span class="glitch"> REDACTED </span> forest</em>. If our suspect is still there, it might be too dangerous.</p>
